# Secrets

In web design, when the mouse hovers over an image, text appears, and this can be achieved without using CSS. Instead, JavaScript can be used to dynamically display the text. This effect is utilized to draw the visitor's attention or provide additional information. By using event listeners in JavaScript, the text can be shown or hidden when hovering over the image.
